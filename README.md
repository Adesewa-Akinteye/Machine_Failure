# Binary Classification of Machine Failures


**Machine Failure Prediction**

This project focuses on using machine learning for binary classification to predict machine failures. The goal is to develop a model that can effectively classify whether a machine is likely to fail or not based on historical data.

Key Features:
* Utilizes a variety of machine learning algorithms.
* Preprocessing techniques for feature engineering.
* Evaluation metrics to assess model performance.

**Program and Library Used:**
* Python
* Scikit-learn
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib
